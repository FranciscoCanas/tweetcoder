Running away from all of the noisy neighbours and crazy tourists really worked up my hunger. I stopped at the nearest diner, ordered a cup of their watery coffee and a rather unspectacular burger that came out of the grill half carbonized. Strangely enough, the fries that came with it were magnificent. Thusly nourished, I returned to the excruciating heat and noise of the streets. It's not so bad, when you don't know anyone.
